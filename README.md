## ðŸ‘‹ Hello and Welcome!

I'm a data scientist with interest in,Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have a background in Engineering, Chemical Engineering to be precise. I was a data scientist intern at DataBunk Nigeria where I learnt more and as well taught Data Analysis and Data science.I also coordinated a project to analyze consumer segments and other demographic information to provide insight for product development, usage and marketing opportunities. 

I have experience in data acquisition and modeling, statistical analysis, machine learning and data analytics. I exercised skills in communication, critical thinking and conflict management and consistently contributed to team efforts and organizational improvements. I am open-minded and focused on new developments in my field. I have proven to be effective and motivational, with proficiency in leadership and collaborative work. I enjoyed brainstorming and coordinating efforts to achieve a common goal.

Outside of data science, I'm an avid reader, I enjoy action movies, and popcorn.
